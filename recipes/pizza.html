        <h3>Ingredients</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Active dry yeast</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Canola oil</li>

        <h3>Steps</h4>
        
            <ol>
                <li>In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. 
                    Add oil and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms</li>
                <li>Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. 
                    Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. 
                    Meanwhile, cook beef and onion over medium heat until beef is no longer pink, breaking meat into crumbles; drain</li>
                <li>Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each half into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. 
                    Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each crust. 
                    Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese</li>
                <li>Bake at 400Â° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned</li> 
            </ol>
