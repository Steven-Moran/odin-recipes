        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>The pizza is one of the weirdest dishes around the world</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>

            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h4>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Combine flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and garlic powder in a large bowl. 
                    Whisk together egg and milk in a small bowl</li>
                <li>Dip each piece of chicken in egg mixture, then roll in flour mixture. 
                    Repeat so that each piece of chicken is double-coated. Refrigerate breaded chicken for 20 minutes</li>
                <li>Fry chicken in hot oil in batches. Cook until golden brown and juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes. 
                    An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)</li>
                <li>Combine hot sauce and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. 
                    Heat sauce in the microwave until melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Pour sauce over fried chicken; mix to coat</li>
